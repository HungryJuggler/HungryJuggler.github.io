**Videoing the robot****     28****/11/16**

 Starting point: Special Stage 1.1

 Target for the lesson?: concentrating on the robot

 Did I reach my target: Yes

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Today, although my partner was sadly not there, I learnt well but not about coding but about how to control the robot and making it easier to do the experiment . The strategies which were effective were to just go trial and error as there were two buttons for each joint so if the elbow went up instead of down I just pressed the other button and it went the other way.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?**

The thing I think limited my learning was the trial an error. This is because sometimes I was too slow to change it so i mucked up the whole experiment so we had to do the whole experiment again which was annoying me and the two people I was working with (as my partner was not there). The habit I need to improve on is to learn all the commands for the robot so the experiment will be faster and easier.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I think what I will change for next time is to learn all the commands so the experiment will be easier and faster so we can do more fun things with the robots.
