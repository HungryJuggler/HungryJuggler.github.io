Title: The Robot Code

Date: 8/11/16

Starting point: Special Stage 1.1

Target for the lesson?: reading all the code

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

 I learnt how to write code for a robot arm which we will try to use after writing this blog. The strategies which I thought was effective was that my partner and I were working together very fluidly because we were writing on the keyboard and speaking the code very quickly and clearly so we went quicker than we thought as there was quite a bit of code. Also we saw we could make it faster by copying bits of the code repasting it and changing slight bits of it.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?

I don't think anything I did really limited my learning but there was one thing which annoyed me which was either the monitor or the computer was making the screen zoomed in a bit which meant we could not access the exit, enlarger and minimise buttons which was slightly annoying

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

What I will change for next time is my partner and I will try and fix (if it is still there) the zooming in problem then it will be fine
