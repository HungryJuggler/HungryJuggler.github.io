    <td>I learned how to use variables on the FUZE computer and how to show those variables with the print command. I also learned how to add two or more variable together. I also learned how to clear the page with the command CTP. Some strategies I used with my partner was one of us read out the text I needed to copy then I copied it down onto the computer using the keyboard. Then we did a trial run to check everything was right, then if anything was wrong normally the program would say which line it was on the we would go to the raw code and check it then we would run it again and it would hopefully work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning was that I didn't read the actual text so it may be in my short term memory not my long term memory and so I might not remember it if me have a test about the thing we did in that lesson. Also the other thing that limited my learning was that there were quite a few mistakes in the code so I need to work on a habit to automatically check the code before I run the program so it does not waste time and I do more and learn more.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I will change by check that work a lot before I run it as even have a lowercase letter instead of a higher case letter can be the difference between of the program runs or not.
