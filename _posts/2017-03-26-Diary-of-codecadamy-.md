Diary of codecademy 

Tuesday

Exercise : student become the teacher, Just average, exercise 5: It's OK to average

In this exercise I had to write a function average that takes a list of numbers and return the average. I thought this exercise was hard,although I had worked out most of the code in the lesson although it still took some time to actually make it correct.  The but the bit I got stuck on was when I had to divide the total of the time by the letters in numbers, I thought I had got that bit right and I was working on another part of the code, but eventually I fixed that bit of the code and I got it right

Wednesday

Exercise: student become the teacher, Just average, exercise 6: Just Weight and see

In this exercise which I found quite easy I had to write a function called get_average that takes a student dictionary as input and returns his/her average score. This exercise was easy because the instructions told me exactly want to do.

Thursday

Exercise: student become the teacher, Just average, exercise 7: Sending a letter

This exercise was even easier than the last, all I had to do was write a function (get_letter_grade) that takes a number score as input and returns a string with the letter grade that that student should receive. So all I had to do was something short for example ,if score>= 90:  return 'A'. Overall this has been the easiest exercise I have done so far.

Friday

Exercise: student become the teacher, Just average, exercise 8: Part of the whole

This exercise was quite easy although I did struggle with a small part of the code. In this exercise I had to get the average for each student and then calculate the average of those averages. The bit I got stuck on was in a part of the code I had to make a empty list, but I didn't realise I had to put empty brackets on the end ( [] ), so I spent a few minutes figuring that out but overall it was quite easy

Saturday

Exercise: student become the teacher, Just average, exercise 9: How is Everybody Doing?

This was a very easy exercise as all I had to do was print out the class average grade and mark, which I just had to do with a simple print code. This was the easiest exercise this week.

I have finished this section and I am now on Lists and Functions and also I am on 52%

Sunday

Exercise: lists and functions, List recap, exercise 1 and 2: 

This exercise was so easy, all I had to do was write print n[1], so I decided to go on to the next exercise. On this was I go a bit confused as I had to times the second element on n by 5 and replace the answer with it, but it didn't take long till I figured it out, but this exercise was still this exercise was hard compared to the other ones I did throughout the week.
