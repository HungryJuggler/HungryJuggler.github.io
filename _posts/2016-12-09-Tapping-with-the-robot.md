**Tapping with the robot  5/12/16**

 Starting point: Special Stage 1.1

 Target for the lesson?: learn the commands for the robot

 Did I reach my target: Yes

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Today happily made partner was here so we could do more stuff with the robot. I think I learnt well as although we didn't really learn anything about coding or the commands of the robot we learnt its capabilities.the strategies which I thought was effective was simply trial and error. When we thought of something for the robot to do we first tried to do and if it worked we videoed it and if it didn't work we simplified it and so on.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?**

The thing I think limited my learning was the trial and error strategies as it took quite a lot of time thinking about how to simplify the action. The habit I need to improve on is thinking it through so we get to do more Experiments.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I think what I will change for next time is to think the experiments through logically so it will work first maybe second time so we can do more experiments.
