Title: making lights bright

Date:10/10/16

Starting point: Project Stage 1.4

Target for the lesson?: reading more thoroughly

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

My strategies were the same as two weeks ago when my partner and I took turns writing to the code and the other one read out the code for us to copy on to the computer. I think I learned quite well a we had to either read it and say or listen to it and write it down so we actually learned what it did.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?

I think what I need to improve on is to be clearer and read quicker as I was quite slow in my reading and I made a few mistakes when I was reading out the code so I made my partner make mistakes in the code so we had to read the code again to see the mistake, but my partner also did it when I said it right so it goes both ways. I think habits I need to improve on is I need to speak more clearly

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I think what I will change is that I write the code while my partner reads it out more as we work much quicker when I wrote the code. I will improve my learning by speaking more clearly for my partner so we can work quicker.
