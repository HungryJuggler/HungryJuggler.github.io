Lesson review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

I learned how to use a ( I am not sure what it is called) command so we could say my name or our favorite sport or are favourite colour etc. and it would say something like, Oh you like football, well I like rugby or Your favorite colour is blue, well mine is pink! Which (although it was slightly difficult) I thought was really cool.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?

I think what limited my learning was that when I was writing all the code down onto the computer using the keyboard I made a few mistakes so the habit I think I need to work on is that I need to practise my keyboard skills so I can type faster more fluents and with much less mistakes as I was making a mistake every three lines or so.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I think the thing I need to do for next time is to practise at home doing keyboard skills so I can become more fluent. This will help my learning as I it will help me type faster so me and my partner can learn more over the lesson.
