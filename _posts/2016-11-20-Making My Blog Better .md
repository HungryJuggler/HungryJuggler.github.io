**Making My Blog Better****                             ****14/11/16**

 Starting point: Special Stage 1.1

 Target for the lesson?: Fixing the screen

 Did I reach my target: No

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

I only learnt a few things today but the strategies I did to help me learn was just look it up on the internet as we mostly fixing our blog and making better. In the short time that we were coding the strategies which I thought was effective was read thoroughly even though you should do that anyway I did it more thoroughly. But overall I think I learnt very well.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?**

I think what limited my learning was mostly on the internet. This is because when I looked something up there was normally lots of rubbish websites or links to questions which were completely irrelevant, which was quite annoying but normally I eventually I found a decent website which actually gave me the answer. I think I need to improve by quickly judging if a website will actually give me the answer

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I think what I will change for next time is to try to set up quicker so I get more time coding as I didn't get much time to code as primarily cause of that is me not setting up fast enough so we only got about 5 minutes of coding.
