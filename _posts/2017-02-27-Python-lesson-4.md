**Python lesson 4. 20/2/17**

 What we did today:

 today was our fourth lesson on codecadamy which we carried on with learning python

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective **

I am really pleased with the amount I did today, this is because I went up 6% which is the furthest I progressed it one lesson. So now I am on 29% which I'm proud of. I didn't find any new "strategies" in this lesson but I used the ones I had already found like reading the information twice to fully understand it and check through my code as I go

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?**

Today, for once, I don't really think anything limited my learning. There were two or three small things like sometimes I pressed the wrong keys on the keyboard or not put the code on the right line or missing an indent. But they were quickly solved so it wasn't really a problem. The habits I need to improve on probably to look at my keyboard when I am typing so I don't accidently press the wrong key.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

The thing I will for next time is to improve my keyboard work by maybe doing some keyboard exercises or something like that. To improve my learning I will take some mental notes on how to use some pieces or code.
