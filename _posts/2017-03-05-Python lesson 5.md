**Python lesson 5. 27/2/17**

 What we did today:

 today was our fifth lesson on codecadamy and once again we carried on with learning python

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective **

This lesson I did much much better than last week, I started on 29% and finished on 38%! Which is nearly a whole 10%! The strategies that I found effective were to read it through twice and sometimes I didn't understand it the first way through and try to do it anyway, with varying amounts of success. Another strategy i found to be effective was to people around me.

              **What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?**

I think what limited my learning was that I got distracted by the people around me. Although I did go through 9% it was mostly easy exercises I probably would have done a bit more if I had not got distracted. The habits I need to improve on is to focus on my work instead of the people around me.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

The thing I will change for next time is to focus more on my work and hopefully I will achieve more than 10% in one lesson. I will improve my learning by trying to use codecadamy every single day as I have being on it the majority of days but not everyday, so I will try and go on it everyday.
