**Google Sheets Coding**

Over four weeks we have amassed knowledge on coding in google sheets. We have explored different possibilities on what we can do on google sheets, most of which I never knew you could do. 

In week one, we decided to use our newly found coding prowess to make some encryption code.  We started  by changing the alphabet to our chosen letters, for example I changed A to B, B to D, C to F etc. You can see the whole code in the original sheets document below.

Then we used the code we had learnt in the lesson to encode messages using =vlookup, for example when I wrote Hello World into my encoding device in came out as Pjxxc Scxih.

In week two we perfected this basically doing the same thing, but perfecting the code. Also at the end we looked a bit into decoding the encoding code.

In week three we looked at =concatenate, which basically put all the words together from your encoding. Then we looked at decoding our concatenated code by setting up a little coding area ( which is demonstrated in the sheets above and below in the screenshot).

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/9cdiDzppw4Vj3RPWIEHK6A_img_0.png)                                                                     

This is a screenshot from the code I was describing above, as you can see the code takes the encoded word from concatenate and puts it, one letter at a time through the code in the line, Left.  On the line below, Factor, it shows which letter it is, for example, on the column 1 it has the first letter, and on column 2 it has the 1st and 2nd letter, etc.

In week four we look at Switch I/O and SPLIT. Switch I/O is basically if there is a new letter it puts one if there is not it puts 0. Split basically explains itself it splits the code into different columns as you can see above.

This is all we have done this far but hopefully we continue with the coding in sheets.
