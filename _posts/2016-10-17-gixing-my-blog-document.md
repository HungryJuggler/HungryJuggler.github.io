Target for the lesson?:checking through my work

Did I reach my target: no

Lesson review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

I learned how to fix my blog and how to make a new blog page. Some strategies that were effective were to look on a google slides which my teacher posted on google classroom with other helpful things like how to post your blog using gabrial

 

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?

I think what limited my learning was that I didn't read through the slides properly so when I got to actually making/fixing my blog I didn't really understand it fully so I didn't finish it in the lesson so I had to at home as I was too slow. I need to work on reading  fully so I can finish the work faster and understand it better.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I think what I will change is to read the code more fully so I understand I better.
