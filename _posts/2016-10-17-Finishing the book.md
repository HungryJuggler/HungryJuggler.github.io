Title:Finishing the book

Date: 17/10/16

Starting point: Project Stage 4.1

Target for the lesson?: Not missing out parts of the code

Did I reach my target: Yes

Lesson review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

I learnt how to making flashing light and also (which I thought was quite cool) we made a code which after a bit of time it printed on the screen " ALARM ACTIVATED!!" and started (we could see from the code) to flash the lights which I thought was really cool. Also We did some other code but we didn't know what it did as we didn't have the light to make it work but it was still fun writing the code in.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to improve on?

I think what limited my learning was that both my partner and I did was that when we read out the code from the book we sometimes missed something out small like a bracket or a number which completely mucked up the whole code and then we had to go back through it or sometimes one of us spotted the mistake and fixed it. The habit that I need to improve is to not miss out parts of the code.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

Next time I will change by (if we say the code out loud to my partner) reading it and reading out every single bit of code so we do not ruin the code with a small mistake that we could have easily missed if we just read it all out. I could improve my learning by maybe practising while I read a book I will read it out loud and try not to miss anything out.
